## The Terrain

### THE BOARD

Seem familiar? It should. The **_Terrain_** uses the standard pattern to orient game pieces. The symbols scattered across the board represent **_bonus tiles_**, further enhancing gameplay with special rules. While the board is larger than its precursors' (at 10x10 versus 8x8), bonus tiles and game cards help to accelerate gameplay. The enemy threat demands a more urgent pace at times.
